### Learning Goals:
The learning goals were to gain more experience working with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. I to the best of my abilities matched an existing comp and provided functionality to all present buttons. 

### Wins + Challenges:
I still have a lot to learn when it comes to all three Javascript, CSS, and HTML, but it was nice to get my hands in some code and attempt this. Some wins were seeing it appear on the screen correctly and also follow the code and see what exactly was happening on the page. The challenge was when nothing would happen on the page and figuring out where I needed to be to see change happening. A lot of room for growth, but at least I know what I''ll be having for dinner, Chicken parm, garden side salad, and cheesecake!
